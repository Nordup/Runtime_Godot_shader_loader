# Runtime_Godot_shader_loader
### Little Godot 3.3 project for playing with shaders
### You can change then load GDScript and Godot shader source at runtime. Aply them to the primitive shapes.

Write any GDScript code you need to do it look beautiful: load textures, generate noise, change uniforms, change them over time ...
> Can any other game engine do this? It's amazing! I'm very happy with this:)
